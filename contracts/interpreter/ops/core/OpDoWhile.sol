/// @title OpWhile
/// @notice Opcode for looping while the stack top is nonzero. As we pre-allocate
/// all the memory for execution during integrity checks we have an apparent
/// contradiction here. If we do not know how many times the loop will run then
/// we cannot calculate the final stack height or intermediate pops and pushes.
/// To solve this we simply enforce that the stack height MUST NOT change between
/// loop iterations. Values MAY be popped and pushed to the stack within a single
/// loop iteration but the final height must remain unchanged. The EVM itself
/// gives a guard against infinite loops in the form of gas, so we do not need to
/// solve for that ourselves. Unlike call, the looping construct does not build
/// a new stack so the called source will be executing from the current stack
/// position with full access to all stack data. Call and loop MAY be combined
/// safely if a new stack is desired for each iteration.
