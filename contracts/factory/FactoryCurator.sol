/// factories. Users that can directly interact with factory contracts or who

/// of a premium frontend will need to pay for the curation unless they tamper
/// with the transaction presented to them by the frontend at moment of deploy.

/// or at least are not technical enough to modify transaction inputs manually.
/// The reliability of the curation fees MUST NOT be assumed to be 100%
/// guaranteed, much as other fees collected in Rain, e.g. sale fees.
/// Curators can also use tier contracts to gate access to curated child
/// deployments which may help build exclusivity features into their services
/// and to meet various geopolitical and regulatory requirements.

/// A single `FactoryCurator` instance is sufficient to service arbitrarily many
/// curators and factories. First curators (or their representative) registers
/// themselves and their terms against the `FactoryCurator`, this assigns an ID
/// to their configuration. Each user then provides the same terms and ID as
